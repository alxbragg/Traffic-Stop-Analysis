# Traffic Stop Analysis - Driver Risk & Enforcement Patterns

This project analyzes over 2 million traffic stop records from a single county in Maryland to identify patterns in enforcement behavior, driver risk, and temporal trends. 
Using Python, SQL, and Power BI, the analysis focuses on when and why traffic stops are most likely to occur, translating raw public data into actionable insights.

## Source
- Source: Public traffic stop records
  https://data.montgomerycountymd.gov/Public-Safety/Traffic-Violations/4mse-ku6q/about_data
- Timeframe: 2012–2025
- Records: ~2.0 million
- Scope: Montgomery county (Maryland)

## Key Preparations
- Normalizing vehicle make values
- Parsing description to map reason for stop
- Parsing and standardizing date/time fields
- Handling null and unknown categories
- Creating derived time based features (hour of the day)

## Tools & Technologies
- Python (pandas & numpy)
- SQL (PostgreSQL)
- Power BI

## Key Questions
- When are drivers most likely to be stopped?
- Which driver and vehicle characteristics are associated with higher stop frequency?
- Which violations most commonly lead to traffic stops?
- How do enforcement patterns differ during low traffic hours?
- Are late night stops disproportionately frequent relative to traffic volume?

## Objective
The goal of this analysis is to identify when and why traffic stops are most likely to occur, and to translate enforcement data into insights that can support risk assessment, policy evaluation and enforcement allocation.

## Key Insights
- Traffic stops peak disproportionately during late night hours (10–11 PM), despite lower overall traffic volume.
  - This suggests higher enforcement visibility and discretion at night, where sparse traffic makes speeding, impaired driving, or erratic behavior easier to detect.
- Speeding is the most common reason for traffic stops across all time periods.
  - However, traffic stops related to speeding occur most often in the morning hpurs. This is higher by 77% comparison to the overall highest traffic stop hour (10pm).
  - This pattern is consistent with commuter behavior, where time pressure during morning rush hours increases the likelihood of speeding.

- Lower nighttime traffic density increases enforcement selectivity, making individual vehicles more likely to be singled out for stops compared to daytime conditions with higher traffic volume.
- Observed differences in stop frequency across driver and vehicle characteristics largely reflect exposure effects rather than elevated risk.
  - Vehicle types and driver groups that appear more frequently in stop data are also those more commonly present on the road, suggesting proportional enforcement rather than targeted disparities.

## Dashboard & Visualizations
An interactive Power BI dashboard was created to visualize:
- Hourly distribution of traffic stops
- Violation type breakdowns
- Geographic concentration of stops

The dashboard is designed to support quick exploration of enforcement patterns and time-based risk.

## Limitations & Assumptions
- The dataset is limited to a single county in Maryland and may not generalize to other regions.
- A small portion of records (<1%) contain invalid or mislocated geographic coordinates, likely due to data entry or geocoding errors.
- Around 50% of the stop reasons and 14% of car makes could not be accurately mapped.
- Traffic volume data was not directly available; conclusions are based on stop frequency patterns.
- Enforcement practices may vary over time due to policy or staffing changes.

## Recommendations
- **Evaluate late night patrol allocation against safety outcomes**:
  Traffic stops peak between 10–11 PM despite lower traffic volume; comparing enforcement intensity with crash and DUI incident data could determine whether late night staffing aligns with actual risk reduction.
- **Incorporate time of day as a contextual feature in behavioral risk models**:
  Late night driving exposure could be weighted as one input among many in insurer or fleet risk models, alongside objective behaviors such as speeding and trip frequency.
- **Improve data entry standardization to strengthen enforcement analytics**:
  High rates of unmapped stop reasons and vehicle makes limit interpretability; structured input fields would enable more reliable policy evaluation and trend analysis.

## Future Improvements
- Integrate traffic volume or population data to normalize stop frequency.
- Expand the analysis to include additional counties or statewide data.
- Improve classification of stop reasons and vehicle makes to reduce unknown categories.
